  Based on the following information about the student:
  Academic Performance: {{{academicPerformance}}}
  Coding Skills: {{{codingSkills}}}
  Extracurricular Activities: {{{extracurricularActivities}}}

  You need to provide:
  1. A list of personalized recommendations (actions). Each recommendation should be specific and actionable.
  2. For EACH recommendation (action), suggest 1-3 diverse learning resources to help the student act on that recommendation. These resources should be structured as follows:
     - 'type': Must be one of "course", "book/pdf", or "youtube_video/channel".
     - 'title': The specific name of the course, book, PDF, YouTube video, or YouTube channel.
     - 'url': (Optional but highly encouraged) A *valid and direct URL* to the resource.
        - For courses: Link to the main page of the course on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, edX, freeCodeCamp, official documentation, university pages, etc.
        - For books/PDFs: If it's an open-access PDF or a public domain book (e.g., from Project Gutenberg, an academic archive), provide the direct URL. If it's a commercially available book, you might omit the URL or link to a general information page (not a direct purchase link from a specific retailer).
        - For YouTube: Link directly to the specific video or the main page of the channel.
        - Strive to find URLs that are likely to be stable and directly useful.
     - 'description': (Optional) A brief note. For example, "Official [Technology] Documentation", "Classic text on algorithms, available on Project Gutenberg", "This YouTube channel offers excellent tutorials on..." or "Search [Book Title] on your preferred bookstore or library."

  Examples of good resource suggestions:
  - For a recommendation "Improve Python skills for data analysis":
    - type: "course", title: "Python for Everybody Specialization", url: "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python", description: "Comprehensive Python course on Coursera."
    - type: "book/pdf", title: "Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney", description: "Industry-standard book, search on O'Reilly or Amazon."
    - type: "youtube_video/channel", title: "freeCodeCamp.org channel - Data Analysis with Python playlist", url: "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnqBxcdjVGgT3uVR10bzTEB"
  - For a recommendation "Build more complex projects using React":
    - type: "course", title: "Full-Stack Open - Part 2: Communicating with server", url: "https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/communicating_with_server", description: "Covers React interactions with backends."
    - type: "book/pdf", title: "React Official Documentation - Thinking in React", url: "https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react", description: "Essential reading from the official React docs."

  3. A list of suggested job roles that align with the student's profile.

  Return the output strictly in the specified JSON format matching the output schema. Ensure all provided URLs are as valid and direct as possible. Prioritize quality and relevance of resources.
